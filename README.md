# ColorTouch Version 1.0
A personal project aimed towards making a speed/accuracy based click game.


Currently in progress. At the moment this only produces a GUI with a set of buttons and labels, and only responds when the "Play!" button is pressed. The end goal to to make a game that gives a set amount of time for the user to click a randomly chosen button from the given set. The buttons and the button to chose changes every time until the timer runs out. The score gained by that time is the Users score. Other goals include creating a "Username creator" and a "High Score Board". Super future goals include recreating this project into a mutli game platfrom with simple games, such as checkers, tik tak toe, and hangman.
